This document is part of a workshop that presented a workflow for working with spatial data common to the space syntax field in the R programming language. The workshop also introduced participants to the rdepthmap package by Petros Koutsolampros, Fani Kostourou and Kimon Krenz. It aimed to make participants familiar with 1) importing spatial data for urban and building scale, 2) running space syntax analysis with the rdepthmap package and 3) managing and plotting these and other related datasets.

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. While the typical purpose of R Markdown documents is to produce reports, this document serves mainly as a relatively visual guide through the code written in the workshop by the tutors.

There are three parts to this:
1. Basic functionality such as data.frames, plotting, making histograms etc.
2. Spatial data and four of its forms:
- Points (SpatialPointsDataFrame), typically used for observations data such as counts
- Lines (SpatialPointsDataFrame), as the usual axial/segment networks used in space syntax
- Polygons (SpatialPointsDataFrame), as plots of land or areas and rooms in buildings
- Pixels (SpatialPointsDataFrame), equivalent to the GIS Raster, as used in Visibility Graph Analysis
3. Space Syntax Analysis using the alcyon package (this part)

Code is only "run" within chunks. Outside the chunk (like this text) the text is interpreted as Markdown Text (a simple annotation format).
Given that the aim of this document is to allow for reproducable workflows, all results and graphs should be created when all the chunks are run in order.
Any function used in this document can be found in the Help documentation or by calling the name of the function with a questionmark before it (i.e. ?plot)

## Space Syntax Analysis using the alcyon package

The alcyon package was created in order to make the functionality of depthmapX available in R. It is a wrapper around the sala and generics libraries which encapsulate the core space syntax functionality without a Graphical User Interface.
All functions called here are available in the Help section or by calling the function with a question mark in front. They can be called either with the prefix alcyon:: or just plain. Here, to make explicit which functions are part of the package they will be called with the prefix.

```{r setup, echo = FALSE}
library(alcyon)
```

### Axial analysis

A typical workflow when using depthmapX is to load line data, convert those lines to an axial map and then do axial analysis.

Let's load line data into R:
```{r}
barnsburySmall = st_read("data/barnsbury/barnsbury_small_axial.mif",
                         geometry_column = 1L, quiet = TRUE)
```

Then convert the map to an Axial ShapeGraph and carry out axial analysis for two radii, "n" and 3. We will also include choice.
```{r}
barnsburySmallAxial = as(barnsburySmall, "AxialShapeGraph")
alcyon::allToAllTraverse(barnsburySmallAxial,
                         radii = c("n", "3"),
                         traversalType = TraversalType$Angular,
                         includeBetweenness = TRUE)
barnsburyAxialAnalysed = as(barnsburySmallAxial, "sf")
```

Finally, let's bring the data back into R using rdepthmap::getShapeGraph() to read the GRAPH file and take a look at the column names of our new SpatialLinesDataFrame.
```{r}
names(barnsburyAxialAnalysed)
```

Let's plot the newly analysed map, this time using one of depthmap's palettes, provided by the package (Axmanesque is the default palette in depthmapX). We will also make the background of the map black using par(bg = "black").
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
par(bg = "black")
plot(barnsburyAxialAnalysed[,'Choice'], pal = rdepthmap::depthmap.axmanesque.colour)
```

### rdepthmap: Segment analysis

To carry out segment analysis, here we first convert the axial map to a segment map and then do segment analysis using three radii, "n", 50 and 100. The radius type used is "metric". As previously names() will give us the columns of our new SpatialLinesDataFrame.
```{r}
barnsburySmallAxial = as(barnsburySmall, "AxialShapeGraph")
barnsburySmallSegment = alcyon::axialToSegmentShapeGraph(barnsburySmallAxial,
                                                         stubRemoval = 0.4)
segmentAnalysed = alcyon::allToAllTraverse(
  barnsburySmallSegment,
  traversalType = TraversalType$Angular,
  quantizationWidth = pi/1024,
  radii = c("n", "50", "100"), 
  radiusTraversalType = TraversalType$Metric,
  includeBetweenness = TRUE,
  weightByAttribute = "Segment Length")

names(segmentAnalysed)
```

Let's then plot the segment map, using depthmapX "classic" palette:
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
par(bg = "black")
plot(segmentAnalysed[,'T1024 Integration [Segment Length Wgt]'],
     pal = rdepthmap::depthmap.classic.colour)
```

Another typical step of the workflow is to identify the "Integration core". That is a subset of the lines the integration of which is above 90% of the overall integration of all lines. The rdepthmap package provides the function rdepthmap::getTopFeatures() for exactly this purpose, which will return the subset as a SpatialLinesDataFrame. Here, the integration core is plotted in thicker lines above the barnsbury segment model
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
integrationCore = alcyon::getTopFeatures(segmentAnalysed,
                                         "T1024 Integration [Segment Length Wgt]",
                                         percent = 0.1)
cols = (100)
par(bg = "black")
plot(segmentAnalysed[, "T1024 Integration [Segment Length Wgt]"],
     pal = rdepthmap::depthmap.axmanesque.colour,
     main = "Segment map with Integration core",
     reset = FALSE)
plot(integrationCore[,1], add = TRUE, col = "red", lwd = 4)
```

### rdepthmap: Visibility Graph Analysis

Finally, we may perform VGA directly from R, by loading a floorplan into a graph, file, defining and filling a grid and carrying out the analysis.

The next chunk loads and plots a simplified National Gallery plan provided here as a pair of MIF/MID files. For more advanced floor-plan loading with more elements, look at the package [dxfspatial](https://github.com/pklampros/dxfspatial)
```{r, fig.width=8}
galleryLines = st_read("data/gallery/gallery_lines.mid",
                       geometry_column = 1L,
                       quiet = TRUE)
plot(galleryLines[,1], key.pos = NULL, main = "Gallery")
```

The next chunk imports the gallery SpatialLinesDataFrame into a GRAPH file, creates a grid with a cell size of 0.04, fills the grid starting from the point 2.86, 6.69 and then makes the graph. Finally, the VGA data is imported into R using rdepthmap::getPointmapData() and plotted.
```{r, fig.width=8}
galleryVGA = alcyon::makeVGAPointMap(galleryLines,
                                     gridSize = 0.04,
                                     fillX = 2.86,
                                     fillY = 6.68)
plot(galleryVGA["Connectivity"])
```

We may also link coordinates (if for example we have different floors):
```{r}
galleryVGA = alcyon::linkCoords(galleryVGA,
                               fromX = 4.81, fromY = 6.67,
                               toX = 2.39, toY = 5.23)
```

And then carry out VGA. The next chunk carries out two modes of VGA, "global-visibility" which calculates metrics such as Visual Mean Depth, Integration and "isovist", which calculates metrics such as Isovist Area, Isovist Min Radial etc. See ?rdepthmap::VGA for more.
```{r, fig.width=8}
galleryVGA = alcyon::allToAllTraverse(galleryVGA,
                                      radii = c(-1),
                                      traversalType = TraversalType$Topological)
galleryVGA = alcyon::vgaIsovist(galleryVGA,
                                boundaryMap = as(galleryLines[, c()],
                                                 "ShapeMap"))

names(galleryVGA)
plot(galleryVGA["Visual Mean Depth"])
```

We may also carry out Agent analysis after we have the grid using the command rdepthmap::agentAnalysis():
```{r, fig.width=8}
galleryAgents = alcyon::agentAnalysis(galleryVGA,
                                      agentLookMode = AgentLookMode$Standard,
                                      timesteps = 5000,
                                      releaseRate = 0.1,
                                      agentFov = 16,
                                      agentSteps = 3,
                                      agentLife = 500,
                                      numberOfTrails = 50)
names(galleryAgents$pointMap)
plot(galleryAgents$pointMap["Gate Counts"])
plot(galleryAgents$trailMap)
```

## Statistics

### Simple aggregates

Finally, we will load some room data to compare to the VGA. More spcifically we will test the average Visual Mean Depth of two galleries. First let's load the galleries as a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame:
```{r, fig.width=8}
galleryFunction = st_read("data/gallery/gallery_polys.mid", geometry_column = 1L, quiet = TRUE)
plot(galleryVGA["Visual Mean Depth"], reset = FALSE)
plot(galleryFunction[,1], add = TRUE, col = "red")
```

Then, let's calculate which pixels overlap with which polygons, and aggregate per polygon. The resulting table is the average Visual Mean Depth of each gallery.
```{r}
galleryVGAPoints = sf::st_as_sf(galleryVGA, as_points = TRUE)
galleryVGAPoints = galleryVGAPoints[!is.nan(galleryVGAPoints[["Visual Integration [HH]"]]), ]
overlapsDF = st_within(galleryVGAPoints, galleryFunction, sparse = F)
overlapsDF = apply(overlapsDF, 1, function(row) { ifelse(any(row), which(row), NA)})
aggregate(galleryVGAPoints["Visual Integration [HH]"], by = list(overlapsDF), mean)
```

In the same vain, let's load some observed activity data and do a similar aggregation:
First let's load the snapshot data as a SpatialPointsDataFrame and add it to the plot as white dots.
```{r, fig.width=8}
gallerySnapshot = st_read("data/gallery/gallery_snapshot.mid", geometry_column = 1L, quiet = TRUE)
plot(galleryVGA["Visual Mean Depth"])
plot(gallerySnapshot, add = TRUE, pch = 20, col = "white")
```

And then let's find the number of people in each gally per activity:
```{r}
overlapsDF = st_within(sf::st_as_sf(gallerySnapshot), galleryFunction, sparse = F)
overlapsDF = apply(overlapsDF, 1, function(row) { ifelse(any(row), which(row), NA)})
aggregate(gallerySnapshot$activity, by = list(overlapsDF, gallerySnapshot$activity), length)
```

### Simple correlation

To carry out simple correlation we'll first load the large barnsbury axial map, convert it to a segment and compare it to gatecounts:

First the segment map:
```{r}

barnsburyLarge = st_read("data/barnsbury/barnsbury_axial.mid",
                         geometry_column = 1L, quiet = TRUE)

barnsburyLargeAxial = as(barnsburyLarge, "AxialShapeGraph")

barnsburyLargeSegment = alcyon::axialToSegmentShapeGraph(barnsburyLargeAxial,
                                                         stubRemoval = 0.4)
segmentAnalysed = alcyon::allToAllTraverse(
  barnsburyLargeSegment,
  traversalType = TraversalType$Angular,
  quantizationWidth = pi/1024,
  radii = c("n", "50", "100"), 
  radiusTraversalType = TraversalType$Metric,
  includeBetweenness = TRUE,
  weightByAttribute = "Segment Length")

```

```{r}
gateCounts = st_read("data/barnsbury/barnsbury_ped_gatecounts.mid",
                     geometry_column = 1L, quiet = TRUE)
```


Plot the segment map with the gatecounts loaded earlier
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
plot(segmentAnalysed[, 'T1024 Choice'], pal = depthmap.axmanesque.colour, reset = F)
plot(gateCounts[,1], add = TRUE)
```

Then match the gatecount points to a line. Each point is assigned here to a single line and vice versa using the command rdepthmap::matchPointsToLines(). The gatecount data are then transferred as a column back into the SpatialLinesDataFrame using cbind()
```{r}
matchedLines = rdepthmap::matchPointsToLines(gateCounts, segmentAnalysed)
segmentAnalysed = cbind(segmentAnalysed, matchedLines)
```

A simple linear model can then be carried out using lm() to create the model and summary() to see the statistics:
```{r, fig.width=8}
frm = as.formula("mov_ped_ph ~ T1024.Choice")
mod = lm(frm, segmentAnalysed)
summary(mod)
```

We may also plot the data in a scatterplot and add a regression line:
```{r}
plot(frm, data = segmentAnalysed)
abline(mod, col = "red")
```

To see residuals and other statistics the model may also be inserted into the plot() function
```{r}
plot(mod)
```

Multiple regression may also be carried out by adding more columns to t
```{r, fig.width=8}
frm = as.formula("mov_ped_ph ~ T1024.Choice + T1024.Integration")
mod = lm(frm, segmentAnalysed)
summary(mod)
```
